# Talk with your PDF's 
This project provide you an interface for interacting with it.

### The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

PDF Loading: The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.

Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

Language Model: The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.

Similarity Matching: When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

Response Generation: The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDFs.
